# Fault detection in Electrical Machine

# Machine Anomaly Detection System

## Overview
This project aims to develop an anomaly detection system for machines using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to detect faults or anomalies based solely on normal operation data, without relying on explicit fault data. The key features of the system are:

## Features
- **Anomaly Detection Model**: Develop a machine learning model trained solely on normal operation data (without explicit fault data) for detecting faults or anomalies in machines.

- **Data Acquisition**: Acquire and store sensor data (vibration) from the target machines during normal operation for model training and analysis.

- **Edge Computing Optimization**: Optimize the trained ML model for efficient execution on resource-constrained microcontrollers (MCUs) for edge computing, while maintaining acceptable performance.

- **Communication Protocol**: Establish a communication protocol to transmit detected anomaly information from the package to a monitoring system for real-time analysis and alerting.
